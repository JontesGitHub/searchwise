# SearchWise
### - Simple Search Engine

###### This project is using Tf-Idf, In.Mem storage and the command line.

#### To use the project:
1. Run the main.java
2. In the running terminal write ``-help`` to see all possible commands

I built this program in mind for making it simple to add stuff, 
for example: add REST API or switch out to real databases.

PS. This program only works with taking one set of documents at the time. 
To use another set of documents please ``-exit`` and start again 
(this cleans the storage).
